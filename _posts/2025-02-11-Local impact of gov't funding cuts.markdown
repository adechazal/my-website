# Local Impact and the Path Forward

Amy Wilson, the self-described local weirdo behind the “Neighborhood Character” Substack, recently shared an enlightening perspective on the evolving challenges facing Jersey City nonprofits. With **government funding dwindling** under the new presidential administration, many nonprofits that rely heavily on these grants are facing a precarious future.

In her blog post "[Jersey City Nonprofits are in really big trouble](https://open.substack.com/pub/neighborhoodcharacter/p/issue-186-jersey-city-nonprofits?utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)", Amy argues that the absence of reliable government support means that local nonprofits must now depend on alternative sources of funding. The obvious solution seems to be **turning to wealthy individuals and large corporate donors**. However, securing that funding is more complex than it may seem. While generous local companies like SILVERMAN Building Inc. contribute significantly, they simply cannot be expected to bridge the growing funding gap on their own.

The challenge is compounded by Jersey City’s **limited corporate giving culture**. Many truly big donors prefer New York, where their contributions can buy them bigger reciprocal publicity or access to more senior business leaders (eg. think NY Charity Galas). It’s not that there aren’t large corporations here. Amy points to Prudential in Newark as being and good example of local engagement and she raises the question of whether Jersey City could cultivate its own local “Prudentials.” We have the businesses here. Global corporations, such as **DTCC**, are active in philanthropy, but I’m guessing only a small fraction of their corporate donations and volunteer activities benefit Jersey City directly.

Ultimately, the challenge Amy lays out is clear: **Can Jersey City reshape its corporate giving culture** and inspire larger, more strategic contributions and engagement from large corporate donors? As the landscape shifts, finding innovative solutions will be crucial for sustaining the city’s vibrant nonprofit sector.
