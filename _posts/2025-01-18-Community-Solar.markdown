This is the draft of a blog post I am writing for Sustainable Jersey City.

# Did you catch our Community Solar campaign this past summer?

No, you missed it? You’re not alone. After a month of emails, social media posts, and telephone calls, it remains one of Jersey City’s best-kept secrets. So, what’s going on, Jersey City folks? Why is this program still so unknown? Let’s talk…

I should mention that I’m relatively new to Jersey City, having just returned to North America after more than 25 years abroad. So, I may have been the last to know about how these local energy programs work. It may also help explain my naive assumption that Community Solar would practically sell itself. Turns out, it does not.

## The Basics: Solar you don’t install

The first thing to know about Community Solar is that you don’t need to install panels. A New Jersey company, Solar Landscape, installs these on top of warehouses, schools, or unused land. Once the project is active, the energy collected is fed back into the grid, which, in my case, is managed by PSE&G.

Now, to benefit from the cheaper and greener energy, you need to sign up for the program. Participants then save, through a credit arrangement with their provider, **31% savings on their electricity bill**. As Deb Italiano, founder and board member of SJC and participant in the program says, it’s an arrangement where really everyone wins.

## Why do I need to sign up?

But why, you might ask, do I need to sign up? If the energy comes from PSE&G and I’m already a PSE&G customer, why isn’t my bill automatically cheaper?

### Designed for Equity, Powered by Community

The answer lies in how community solar is designed and incentivized by the State of New Jersey. This isn’t simply about “cheaper electricity for the utility.” Instead, the benefits are distributed through an enrollment program that aims to expand access, ensure equity, and foster local engagement. That means everyone, especially low-and-middle-income households, can have equal access to solar power.

For these programs to succeed, companies like Solar Landscape must actively involve local communities. And that’s where organizations like Sustainable Jersey City come in. SJC works with Solar Landscape for a small referral commission to help promote the service to you, the residents of Jersey City. Our efforts help to build a sense of community ownership and awareness that doesn’t happen if everything is handled behind the scenes.

## Bringing the Community On Board

But moving the community to solar is not easy. As my fellow SJC member Devin Taylor says, *“energy transformation needs more project managers, not PhDs!”* He has a point. Solar Landscape can produce heaps of gigawatts of solar energy, but unless there’s an effective and coordinated effort on the ground and in the communities, it’s not going anywhere. Unfortunately—and somewhat surprisingly to me—the simple offer of **31% savings on your electricity bill** doesn’t sell itself.

So, we have deepened our outreach efforts in the community. We are now working closely with respected local leaders and businesses that can help provide a trustworthy voice and champion the benefits. Most recently, the Silverman Building Co. and Choc O’Pain companies have agreed to be Community Solar Ambassadors and help promote registrations with their employees or tenants. Having a trusted voice in the community to vouch for these benefits will help. And based on the success of this partnership, we’re looking to work with more local building owners and businesses.

## Looking Ahead: Be Part of the Solution

So, look out for our flyers, social media posts, and emails. And don’t be afraid to find out more. You’ll be helping your community, and the offer is real: **31% savings off your electricity bill**. Just because I’m new to all this doesn’t mean you have to be left in the dark. Let’s bring this program to life—together!
