# Learning about Community Solar

Did you catch our Community Solar campaign this past summer? No, you missed it? You’re not alone. After a month of emails, social media posts, and telephone calls, it's still one of Jersey City’s best-kept secrets. 

So, what’s going on, Jersey City folks? Why is this program still so unknown? Let’s talk…

## A Newcomer’s Perspective

I should mention that I’m relatively new to Jersey City, having just returned to North America after more than 25 years abroad. So, I may have been the last to know about how these local energy programs work. It may also help explain my naive assumption that Community Solar would practically sell itself. Turns out, it does not.

## The Basics: Solar You Don’t Install

The first thing to know about Community Solar is that you don’t need to install panels. A New Jersey company, Solar Landscape, installs these on top of warehouses, schools, or unused land. Once the project is active, the energy collected is fed back into the grid, which, in my case, is managed by **PSE&G**.
