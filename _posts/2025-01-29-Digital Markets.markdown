# Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology – The White House

Things are looking up for the Crypto-Bros.

At least that’s how it appears after the White House’s recent Executive Order on digital financial technology. The policy change aims to **promote and protect** the use and fair access of digital assets, while **clarifying regulations** and setting the stage for a more **transparent, innovative, and competitive financial future**.

## What’s In?
- **Using Crypto**
- **Fair and Open Access**
- **Self-Custody**
- **Stablecoins**
- **Transparent Decision Making**

## What’s Out?
- **CBDCs in the US**
- **Unlawful Censorship**

## What’s to Be Decided?
- **A National Crypto-Reserve**

Also, we will see the formation of a **dedicated working group** tasked with hashing out the details and shaping the path ahead. This group will bring together **regulators**, **industry leaders**, and **financial experts** to determine how to **safely nurture innovation** without stifling competition.

It still feels like it will be **years** before we can buy pizza with BTC or trade Coke shares on the blockchain, but perhaps that day **got a little closer**.
