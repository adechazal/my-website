# Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology – The White House

This month the new US administration issued an Executive Order that sets a new tone for innovation in Financial Markets and Financial Services. 

Titled: "[Strengthening American Leadership in Digital Financial Technology](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/strengthening-american-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/)", the policy change aims to promote a clearer regulatory environment for digital assets and set the stage for more transparency, innovation, and competition in financial markets. It will not only strengthen ‘Decentralized Finance’ but may also force ‘Traditional Finance’ to take notice and reconsider many of its legacy processes.

Also, we will see the formation of a dedicated working group tasked with hashing out the details and shaping the path ahead. This group will bring together regulators, industry leaders, and financial experts to determine how to safely nurture innovation without stifling competition.

Although I don't expect 2025 to be the year when I can buy pizza with Bitcoin or trade Coke shares on a blockchain, it suggests that such possibilities might be getting closer. Meanwhile, traditional financial systems like the NYSE could shift to nearly 24-hour trading as a competitive response to this new policy.
