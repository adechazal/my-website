# A Win for Community Solar

On Friday I had the pleasure to join the official on-boarding of SILVERMAN Inc. into Solar Landscape’s Community Solar program.

SILVERMAN building inc. is now a “Community Solar Ambassador” and will help to promote sign-ups for the Solar Landscape community outreach program. 

Solar Landscape is a family built solar power business in New Jersey. They install solar panels on warehouses and provide that back to the grid. New Jersey residents can then sign-up to benefit from guaranteed discounted electricity in a program called ‘Community Solar’.

Sustainable Jersey City introduced the two parties together to collaborate in this effort.
