# Are financial markets too fragmented? 

This [report](https://impact.economist.com/projects/cost-of-fragmentation/) by the Economist Impact and commissioned by SWIFT makes the case that we are currently in a world of financial fragmentation. And, the future of fragmentation is bleak - “there are no winners”. They define financial fragmentation as “a reduction in international financial integration and the disruption of cross-border payments, credit and investment that ultimately reduces cross-border capital flows”. And the cost of this disarray is, in a worse case scenario; “global GDP roughly 6% lower and nearly 280 million fewer jobs.”    

Reducing fragmentation, according to SWIFT, requires harmonious regulation, standards, and international cooperation. That would help to reduce risks for investors and strengthen the financial system's integrity. It would help drive continued market and regulatory innovation to leverage the digital tech revolution. A focus on establishing common standards and enhancing interoperability across financial systems will be essential to ensure these solutions work seamlessly and securely across borders.

Unfortunately I feel that SWIFT may be fighting a losing battle here. While harmony sounds better than fragmentation, my best guess is that there will be two separate financial systems. The first is the traditional world which runs on today’s established structures and standards and is governed by an international rule of law - TradeFi. And, a second financial world, ostensibly ‘decentralized’ or fragmented that we can call DeFi. As much as we talk about on-ramps and off-ramps or hope that a simple API will bridge the gap I don’t think these two worlds will ever merge entirely. Instead they will bump along for at least another generation. Until then, or unless you are on the right side of retirement, you may need a foot in both worlds.
